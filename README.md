# 🧠 Logic-Based Problem Solving

This repository contains **logic-based and problem-solving programs** implemented in multiple programming languages.  
It is created to strengthen **programming fundamentals, logical thinking, and interview preparation**.

The same types of problems are solved using:
- **C**
- **C++**
- **Java**
- **Python**

---
Each language folder contains logic-based programs such as:
- Number problems
- Conditional logic
- Loop-based problems
- Basic algorithms
- Beginner to intermediate problem-solving programs

---

## 🧪 Topics Covered

- ✔ Number Logic (even/odd, prime, divisible, factorial)
- ✔ Conditional Statements
- ✔ Loops & Iterations
- ✔ Functions / Methods
- ✔ Arrays & Strings *(language-specific)*
- ✔ Basic Algorithms

---

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository
